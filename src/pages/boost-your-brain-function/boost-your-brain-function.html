  <p>Natural food is known to be the best preventive medicine and sometimes, plays an important role in the field of medicine. Those of us who care about nature know that attempts by man to destroy the nature are suicidal and have significant effects on the future generations. Therefore it becomes fundamental that we should protect the nature. One of the benefits that we can derive from nature is the coconut oil that has been listed as one of the most beneficial in the health of our bodies. One of the coconut oil benefits is that it is known to boost the functioning of the brain and studies conducted have shown that the coconut has several constituents that are necessary for the functioning of the brain. To understand how the brain functioning is improved through the use of unrefined or cold pressed coconut oil let`s first understand some of the conditions that affect the brain to understand coconut oil benefits to the human brain.</p>

  <h2>Dementia</h2>

  <p>One of the major conditions that affect the brain is dementia which is also referred to as diabetes of the brain. The brain needs energy so as to be able to function. The main source of energy is glucose and ketones. Dementia is caused by the death of the brain cells which occurs over time. The death of brain cells is attributed to lack of enough energy to the brain to regenerate new brain cell. Therefore, the patient will continue to have decreased brain cells until the condition is noticed.</p>

  <p>According to statistics, over 5 million Americans of all ages suffer from dementia. Although several factors are known to contribute to the disease, poor dietary habits have been linked to being a major contributor to the disease. Studies have shown that people can protect themselves against dementia by eating foods rich in Ketones and Glucose, and an example is an unprocessed coconut. This has also been backed up by recent studies that showed that people who live in areas where coconut grows report fewer cases of dementia, and this means that improving the functioning of the brain is one of the coconut oil benefits.</p>



  <p>A Recent study conducted on wistar rats by a scientist in Malaysia shows that those rats that were fed on organic coconut oil by having enhanced memory than those who were not exposed to the coconut oil. This has highly motivated studies on coconut oil benefits and has proved that the same happens to humans.</p>

  <p>Coconut oil benefits the brain because it stimulates the production of brain-friendly ketones. Ketones are the organic compounds that act as a source of energy to the brain when the glucose is not sufficient. Therefore, the people who live near the coastal regions where the coconut is known to grow to eat organic coconut oil. One of the coconut oil benefits to them is the proven by the fact that they reported fewer cases of dementia.</p>

  <p>The ketogenic properties of the coconut oil have led to the recommendation of organic coconut oil as a stimulator of the functioning of the brain. In that light, we can affirm to the fact that unprocessed coconut oil is rich in ketogen which are essential for the generation of new brain cells and therefore prevents dementia promoting the functioning of the brain.</p>
