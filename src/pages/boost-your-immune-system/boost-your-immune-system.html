  <p>The immune system actively protects you by countering infections and harmful toxins. Do have a weak immune system? Your body should no longer suffer from illness such as flu or even allergic reactions. Boost your immune system through numerous coconut oil benefits. Having a weak immune system in this imperfect world is like blindly exposing yourself to bullies.</p>

  <h2>How Coconut Oil Functions</h2>

  <p>Among all natural plant oils, coconut oil is unique because of its high content of potent medium chain fatty acids (MCFAs) which are immune boosters. Significant MCFAs present in the oil, are capric acid, caprylic acid, and lauric acid.</p>

  <p>To activate the anti-microbial properties that can destroy disease-causing organisms the oil has to be digested. After digestion, the medium chain fatty acids are broken down into free fatty acids and monoglycerides.</p>

  <p>The individual fatty acids attack the microbes differently. Some MCFAs might be active in killing certain bacterial infections. Alternatively, they may be less active in destroying microbes. However, you still get an active immunity against diseases and other coconut oil benefits.</p>

  <p>Fatty Acids in Coconut oil and their Functions</p>

  <h2>Caprylic Acid</h2>

  <p>It has essential natural antibacterial, anti-viral, anti-inflammatory and anti-fungal properties. It can create a hostile environment for viruses, reduce candida and fight bacteria.</p>

  <h2>Capric Acid</h2>

  <p>The fatty acid has strong antibacterial and antiviral properties. These make coconut oil able to fight viral and bacterial agents in the body. Capric acid can also help to improve your general wellbeing and overall health.</p>

  <h2>Lauric acid</h2>

  <p>Lauric acid is usually found in the breast milk, where aids the child's immune system. Coconut oil has a high content of lauric acid which has essential and natural anti-microbial properties. Therefore it can either inhibit the growth of microorganisms or kill them.</p>

  <p>Lauric acid from coconut oil is part of an ongoing drug therapy program where is used to reduce the HIV infection. It does this by decreasing the viral load of the HIV patient.</p>

  <p>Monolaurin is a chemical derivative of lauric acid commonly used as a dietary supplement. It can prevent and treat colds, herpes, shingles and other infections. Scientists are still finding ways to use the derivative to provide more coconut oil benefits.</p>

  <p>The medium chain fatty acids are what make coconut oil unique. In fact, it is the most dominant source of MCFAs than any other dietary fats and oils. The medium chain fatty acids are rapidly digested giving you instant energy and the perfect immune system boost.</p>

  <p>Coconut oil also increases an already weak immune system by improving the white blood cells count, which helps the body to fight viruses directly. For the best coconut oil benefits, you can incorporate it in, coffee, smoothies, yogurt, and cereals or take a spoonful every morning.</p>
