  <p>With the different health benefits and uses of coconut oils, it is no wonder that most people are a fan of it. It is the healthiest source of MCT (Medium Chain Triglycerides) and saturated fats. It is also a versatile ingredient that perfectly complements the taste of our snacks and meals. However, in order to realize the full coconut oil benefits, you have to make sure that you are choosing the best. With its variety of versions such as unrefined, refined, expeller-pressed, and extra-virgin, choosing the right one can be overwhelming.</p>

  <p>Choosing the Best Coconut Oil That Will Provide You with Different Coconut Oil Benefits</p>

  <p>Coconut oil is available in different types. We decided to create a guide that will help you choose the best coconut oil for your situation.</p>

  <p>Unrefined or Refined?</p>

  <p>The refined type of coconut oil will usually be odorless and colorless. Since the properties have been refined, it can withstand an elevated temperature before it eventually reached its burning point. The refined type of coconut oil is ideal for cooking where you will need the pure and clean fats minus the taste of coconut. The refined type will not have the same coconut oil benefits of the virgin coconut oil; however, it is still a potent source of essential fatty acids. Refined coconut oils are not created equally; there are refined oils that went into a chemical distillation that utilizes harsh solvent. They can also be hydrogenated that introduce synthetic fats.</p>

  <p>The unrefined type can be labeled as extra virgin and virgin coconut oil which will provide different coconut oil benefits. Every brand will have the particular definition of the models. Contingent upon the process that the oil was pressed, its flavor can be subtle or intense. The extent of time that it was exposed to a high temperature will determine the strength of its flavor.</p>

  <p>Different Method of Extraction</p>

  <p>After choosing from the unrefined and refined coconut oil, you will then have to choose the method of extraction; centrifuged, expeller-pressed and cold-pressed. Depending on the method used, you will have healthy, good, and tasty oil. The cold-pressed and the expeller-pressed will not instantly mean virgin or raw. There are times that it will be exposed to extreme temperatures during the extraction process. This will create a toasted flavor. The centrifuged will produce a subtle and delicate taste. On the off chance that only the term ‘coconut oil’ is written on the label, there is a good chance that it is an RBD. It is quite unclear if there are solvents present on the finished product, but in order to experience the full coconut oil benefits, we recommend choosing coconut oil without any solvent extracts.</p>

  <p>After going through the different labels in the market, you might also want to familiarize yourself about the ‘organic’ coconut oil. It does not contain any pesticides that may affect the coconut oil benefits. Make sure that you will research first and ask the right questions to the sellers to guarantee the efficacy of the product.</p>
